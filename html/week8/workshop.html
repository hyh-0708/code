              <span>In this experiment, we used an Infrared (IR) Receiver module in combination with a buzzer, aiming to build a basic obstacle detection and response system using the Arduino Uno.</span>
              <br />
              <span>Arduino Uno (Elegoo Edition)</span>
              <span>Serves as the microcontroller, responsible for receiving and processing the signal data from the IR receiver.</span>
              <span>Infrared Receiver</span>
              <span>The small black three-legged component placed on the breadboard. It is used to receive infrared signals from a remote control. When a button on the remote is pressed, the IR receiver captures the signal and sends data to the Arduino for interpretation.</span>
              <span>Resistor</span>
              <span>Likely used to pull down or pull up one of the IR receiver pins (often the output signal pin) to stabilize the signal or limit current as needed.</span>
              <span>Breadboard and Jumper Wires</span>
              <span>Used for non-permanent circuit construction and easy wiring between components.</span>
              <span>USB Cable and Computer</span>
              <span>Used to upload Arduino code and provide power to the board.</span>

            <span>This isÂ  actual setup of a simple distance-based alarm system built with a microcontroller, a distance sensor, and a buzzer on a breadboard.</span>
            <br />
            <span>Microcontroller Board</span>
            <span>Connected to a laptop via USB to receive power and upload code.</span>
            <span>Breadboard</span>
            <span>Used to arrange and connect the components without soldering.</span>
            <span>Distance Sensor</span>
            <span>Positioned on the right side of the breadboard, it detects how far an object is from the sensor using sound waves.</span>
            <span>Buzzer</span>
            <span>A black circular component that emits sound when triggered, used as an alert signal.</span>
            <span>Resistor</span>
            <span>Placed in the circuit to control current or stabilize signal input/output.</span>
            <span>Jumper Wires</span>
            <span>Various colored wires that connect the components to the microcontroller and complete the circuit.</span>
            <br />
            <span>The sensor continuously measures the distance between itself and any nearby object.</span>
            <span>When an object comes too close, the buzzer is triggered and produces a sound.</span>
            <span>Once the object moves away and the distance increases, the buzzer stops.</span>
            <span>This hands-on experiment demonstrates how input data from a sensor can be used to control an output device, helping us understand basic interactive system design.</span>

            <span>In a later experiment, we explored a more creative and interactive way to control input by using natural conductive materials. We used a potato, a lemon, and aluminum foil as electrodes to detect bioelectric signals from the human body.</span>
            <span>Materials Used:</span>
            <br />
            <span>Potato and Lemon:</span>
            <span>These fruits and vegetables contain moisture and electrolytes, making them weak conductors of electricity.</span>
            <span>Aluminum Foil:</span>
            <span>Used as a low-cost electrode or touch surface to enhance conductivity and allow easy contact with the human skin.</span>
            <span>Arduino Uno:</span>
            <span>Acts as the microcontroller to measure the signal and respond accordingly.</span>
            <span>Buzzer:</span>
            <span>Used as the output device, triggered when the signal is detected.</span>
