              <span>DELQA is an immersive, interactive music installation created by electronic musician Matthew Dear in collaboration with a creative design team. It was showcased at the New Museum's NEW INC program in New York. The goal of the project was to transform passive listeners into active co-creators of the music.</span>
              <br />
              <span>As participants moved through the installation space, they triggered different sounds and rhythmic patterns by interacting with custom-built, sensor-equipped structures. The music responded in real time, creating a living, reactive soundscape that shifted with every user’s movement.</span>

            <span>Blurs the Line Between Audience and Performer: Instead of watching or listening passively, visitors became creators of the soundscape;</span>
            <span>Truly Immersive: Through a blend of movement, sound, and light, DELQA created a full-body experience; Technology as a Medium: By integrating motion tracking and generative sound software, the artists redefined the boundaries of what a sound installation could be;</span>

            <span>What intrigued me most about DELQA is the concept that music isn’t just something we listen to—it’s something we actively create through movement. Each experience is completely unique, shaped by the audience’s gestures, presence, and decisions. It challenged me to rethink design as something participatory and performative, where interaction becomes composition. Moving forward, I’m excited to explore how physical spaces can be transformed into instruments, and how user behavior can directly influence and co-create immersive experiences.</span>
