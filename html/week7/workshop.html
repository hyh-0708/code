              <span>During this class, we were first introduced to all the basic electronic components.</span>
              <span>We learned about the functions of each individual part, including various types of capacitors, and gained an understanding of how a machine needs to be structured in order to operate according to our intentions. This includes knowing what kind of process it needs to follow and how many components are required to make it work.</span>
              <span>No matter what kind of hardware you want to drive, at the very minimum, you will need a breadboard, resistors, jumper wires, a power supply module, and a power source. Each of these plays a specific and essential role in building a functional circuit:</span>
              <span>∑       Breadboard: This is a tool used for prototyping circuits. It allows us to easily insert and remove components and wires without the need for soldering. This makes testing and modifying circuits quick and convenient, especially for beginners or during the design phase.</span>
              <span>∑       Resistor: A resistor is used to control the flow of electric current within a circuit. It can be used to limit current, divide voltage, or protect other components from receiving too much power. Resistors are essential for ensuring that circuits operate safely and efficiently</span>
              <span>∑       Jumper Wire: These wires are used to connect different components on the breadboard. You can think of them as the internal “data cables” of a device, enabling electrical signals to travel between components. Without jumper wires, it would be impossible to establish connections across different parts of the circuit.</span>
              <span>∑       Power Supply Module: This module is responsible for delivering power to the circuit. It provides a stable and consistent voltage and current, which is crucial for the proper functioning of electronic components. The power supply module connects to a power source—this could be a battery, a computer USB port, or another form of external power.</span>
              <span>this class gave us a fundamental understanding of how electronic circuits are structured and the basic building blocks needed to bring a machine to life.</span>

            <span>Of course, when more complex functions are required, the basic components mentioned above are no longer sufficient. In such cases, we need to introduce a more powerful device: the Arduino Uno.</span>
            <br />
            <span>The Arduino Uno can be thought of as a small, programmable computer. It contains an IC (Integrated Circuit) that acts as a CPU, along with I/O (Input/Output) ports and an external power interface. What makes Arduino especially useful is that it can interpret and execute computer programming instructions to control a wide variety of electronic components.</span>
            <br />
            <span>For example, with an Arduino Uno, we can control a ultrasonic sensor to measure distance or detect obstacles. This opens the door to building more sophisticated systems such as automated doors, obstacle-avoiding robots, or even smart home devices. By uploading code written in the Arduino programming language (based on C/C++), we can define how the board interacts with sensors, LEDs, motors, and many other modules.</span>
            <br />
            <span>In short, the Arduino Uno acts as the "brain" of the project. It not only coordinates how different components behave but also makes it possible to bring complex interactive ideas to life through simple coding.</span>

              <span>After becoming familiar with the basic components, we began to set up our first simple experiment. The circuit consisted of just a breadboard, resistors, jumper wires, a power supply module, a power source, an LED light, and a switch.</span>
              <br />
              <span>Despite its simplicity, this setup allowed us to understand one of the most fundamental concepts in electronics: controlling the flow of electricity using a switch. In this case, the switch was connected in such a way that we could turn the LED on or off by opening or closing the circuit.</span>
              <br />
              <span>This hands-on experience helped reinforce how each component plays its role in the system. The resistor ensured the LED received the correct amount of current to avoid burning out, the jumper wires made the necessary electrical connections, and the breadboard provided a stable and flexible base for assembling everything without soldering.</span>

              <span>As we progressed further, we took on a slightly more advanced experiment involving a fan. In this setup, we were able to control the fan’s rotation speed using a switch, much like how we had previously controlled the LED.</span>
              <br />
              <span>Fundamentally, this circuit was not drastically different from the one with the LED. The key changes were that we replaced the LED with a fan, adjusted the resistor to suit the fan's voltage and current requirements, and added a controller component to help regulate the speed and power delivery to the fan.</span>
              <br />
              <span>This experiment helped us understand how the same basic principles—such as circuit design, component selection, and power control—can be scaled or adapted to work with different output devices. It also reinforced the idea that by simply swapping or modifying a few components, we can completely change the behavior and functionality of a system.</span>
