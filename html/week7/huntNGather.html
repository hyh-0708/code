              <span>EyeWriter</span>
              <span>Overview:</span>
              <span>The EyeWriter is a low-cost, open-source eye-tracking system designed to enable individuals with severe physical disabilities—such as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) patients like the graffiti artist TEMPT1—to draw and create using only their eye movements. By wearing a custom-built eye-tracking headset, users can move their eyes to control a digital pen on the screen and create visual artwork in real time.</span>
              <br />
              <span>Interaction Design:</span>
              <span>The device tracks the user's eye movements and translates them into drawing strokes on screen. This allows for intuitive, hands-free creative expression—controlled purely by where the user is looking.</span>
              <br />

            <span>Significance & Social Impact:</span>
            <span>EyeWriter stands as a powerful example of how accessible technology can give voice and agency to individuals who are otherwise unable to communicate. Particularly for ALS patients in advanced stages—where only eye movement remains functional—this device can become a lifeline to the outside world and a tool for self-expression.</span>
            <br />
            <span>This project not only showcases technological innovation but also highlights how design can serve humanity in deeply meaningful ways. The simplicity and affordability of EyeWriter make it an empowering solution for many who are often left out of the creative process due to physical limitations.</span>
